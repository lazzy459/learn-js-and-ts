# Task 2: Creating simple JavaScript code and committing it to GitHub using Git.

In this task, I will learn the fundamentals of using Git to manage code efficiently and understand the concept of branching using GitHub Flow. I will also study how to initialize a repository, commit changes, and create and manage branches to understand the workflow commonly used in the industry. Additionally, I will practice writing simple scripts in JavaScript and TypeScript.

Before we begin, make sure to prepare the following:

- Code Editor: You can use any code editor, such as Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, or others.
- Git: After installing your code editor, ensure that Git is installed on your system to manage version control and collaborate with GitHub.
- GitHub Repository: Once your code editor and Git are installed, create a GitHub account and a new repository to store and share your completed code.

# Understanding the Basics of Git

We will practice using the task shown in the example image to understand the Git workflow for professional code management in an organization or company. The steps I will take are:

1. **Initializing the Repository :**
  Create a new directory, initialize Git inside it, and configure basic Git settings as needed.
2. **Making Changes and Committing :**
   Add files to the repository and make the necessary modifications. Stage the updated files, then commit the changes with a descriptive message. Finally, push the changes to GitHub to store and share them.

Basic commands in Git include:
- Creates a new Git repository
  ```bash
  git init
  ```
- Adds changes to the staging area
  ```bash
  git add <file>
  ```
- Saves changes to the repository with a descriptive message
  ```bash
  git commit -m "message"
  ```
- Uploads changes to the remote server
  ```bash
  git push
  ```
- Fetches the latest changes from the remote server
  ```bash
  git pull
  ```

  # 1. How to Use Git and GitHub

  Here are the basic steps to use Git and GitHub:

  **a. Installing Git**
  To use Git, you need to install it first. Follow these steps:

  **Windows:**
- Download and install Git from git-scm.com.
- Once installed, open the terminal or Git Bash.

  **MacOS:**
- Use the command:
  ```bash
  brew install git
  ```
  if using Homebrew.

  **Linux:**
- Use the command:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install git
  ```
- (Ubuntu/Debian) or:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install git
  ```
  (Fedora).

  **b. Connecting Git with GitHub**
  1. Create a GitHub account at github.com.
  2. Configure Git with your GitHub account:
  ```bash
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  git config --global user.email "email@domain.com"
  ```
